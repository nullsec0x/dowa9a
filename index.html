        <p>moun* is a young multi media artist that is mainly focused on music originated from Casablanca and now based in Paris, they also makes music under the name pinkshell*. They started making music back 
          in 2020 when they started learning music production and then they kept developing their sound from rap to rnb to punk, but in 2025 they finally found their own sound with the song (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/intl-fr/track/36fjmNzcjMgfntDlP87hLj?si=bd39b01186674bf5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: underline wavy black; text-decoration-thickness: 1px; color: black;">monkey on ketamine*</a>). 
          They describe the sound as coherent chaos, to get to this sound they took inspiration from multiple artists from different genres like (jazz, post punk, hyperpop, emo, rnb, alt rock). In their music moun* try to 
          talk about topics that matter to our generation like phone addiction, politics, gender identity, and they focus a lot on the overall anxiety that most of our generation feel with all the problems going on in the world right now. 
          They're debut ep under the name of moun* (body moving through a screen*) is dropping soon and it's a really creative and experimental peace of art that really needs all our attention, moun* is definitely one of the artists you should be following.</p>
